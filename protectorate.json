During a friendly Faction Warcaster’s activation, it can remove 1 focus point from this model in its control range and gain that focus point. Each warcaster can do this only once per turn. When a focus point is removed from this model, roll a d6. On a 1 or 2, this model explodes with the same effect as Fiery Blast and is removed from play."
